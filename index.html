                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>Hello! My name is Allan Araya, I'm a software engineering student from Costa Rica who is searching for
                         new opportunities to learn and grow. My main motivation in this career is to create new things based on 
                         my own ideas or from other people. The idea to create an app or webpage that can last forever on the internet amazes me everyday.
                         </p>

                        <p>I am a person who when given a task does not stop until it is finished or gives its best to deliver the best possible final product.
                         Searching for new techniques and knowledge is of utmost importance to me since it allows me to be up to date with the needs of clients 
                         and companies, in addition to the fact that acquiring new knowledge amuses and entertains me, so it is a relatively easy process for me.
                        </p>
                        <p>And I like to sleep</p>
